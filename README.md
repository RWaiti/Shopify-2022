# Shopify-2022

## a) Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.

 We can see is that the AOV was calculated using the total amount of sales, not the total amount of sold shoes.

## b) What metric would you report for this dataset?

- Which stores sold the most shoes

- Which stores earned the most

- Most used payment methods

- Weekday with the biggest sales

## c) What is its value?

AOV = $357.92
